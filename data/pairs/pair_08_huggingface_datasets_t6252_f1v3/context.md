## Feature A (branch_a): Add Automatic EXIF Orientation Correction for Images

**Title**: Add Automatic EXIF Orientation Correction for Images

**Pull Request Details**

**Description**:
This feature introduces automatic correction for images with EXIF orientation metadata by applying a transpose operation during image decoding. This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions—particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.

**Technical Background**:
**Problem**:
Images with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.

**Solution**:
The solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically.

## Feature B (branch_b): Add Optional Image Size Clamping with Max Resolution Threshold

**Title**: Add Optional Image Size Clamping with Max Resolution Threshold

**Pull Request Details**

**Description**:
Introduces an optional `max_resolution` parameter to the `Image` feature, which clamps image dimensions during decoding. If an image exceeds the specified width or height, it is downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio.

**Technical Background**:
**Problem**:
High-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.

**Solution**:
The new `max_resolution` parameter enables automatic downscaling of images during `decode_example`. If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds.
